# Knowledge
General Knowledge Repository (Software based)

This repository contains code examples and some theory oriented to **Computer Science** topics.

It should remain minimal in text and more practical driven.
Explenations should be self contained into the code as comments and where not possible into .md files.

This is an on going Repository which should be populated/updated over the professional years,
without forgetting that we always do it cause it is fun!
